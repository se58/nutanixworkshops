Publish your Page
=================
You've completed the content creation, compiled it locally and now want to publish it in readiness for your customer / colleague session. Follow these steps whether you're using a Mac or Windows:

Creating the URL
++++++++++++++++
- Launch a web browser and paste in ``https://nutanix.handsonworkshops.com/manage/workshops/``

You'll see this screen

  :width: 500

- Paste in the URL of your repository, if you're not sure of it then open up the repository on GitHub website

.. image:: /images/clone-url.png
  :width: 300

|

You can see the URL shown here, click the clipboard icon to copy it to your clipboard then paste it to your page

- Complete the rest of the details, as per this example:

.. image:: /images/add-workshop-02.png
  :width: 500

- Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click **Publish**

- The entire process of pushing content to AWS and making it available can take up to 15 minutes, go grab a :fa:`coffee`

- Having been patient and let the time pass refresh the webpage of your browser

- Now you'll see that a URL is available to copy (using the clipboard icon) and distribute

Other features
++++++++++++++

- The option to invite people I personally don't use.  Simply sending the URL to someone or a group of people works fine

- You'll also notice on this screen you have the option to **Refresh Content** and **Archive Workshop**.  The Refresh option allows to re-publish to the same URL once you've made amendments to the code in the GitHub repository.  Archive Workshop, is quite simply that and removes access to the URL.

- The **Enrollment** tab is useful to see who has clicked the link you've sent them and logged in to review the content you've created
